# PHSX815_Week5
This repository contains the code for the home work assignments from week 5 of PHSX 815.

## python code
This file contains the code for sampling the function -3x^2 + 3. This uses the files QuadraticRSampling.py and Random.py to do the sampling and then plot the results.

The Python scripts require the following libraries: `numpy` and `matplotlib`

## Usage
All of the executables can be called from the command line with the `-h` or `--help` flag. The python scripts can be run with the following options

- `python3 python/QuadraticRSampling.py -Nsample [# samples] -range [Xmax]`

## Results
This is the image that was produced by the code.
